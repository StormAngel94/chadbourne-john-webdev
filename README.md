# John Chadbourne's Web Dev Repository

I am a rising Senior Undergraduate Physics major going for minors in Math and Computer Science at Northeastern University.  I have been taking programming classes since i was 13, though I have never worked on any major projects.  I am currently working for Numeric Investors in Boston MA as part of their application support team.  

The purpose of this repository is to handle the code backing the websites I will be creating for Northeastern's Summer 2 2017 Web Development Course.
